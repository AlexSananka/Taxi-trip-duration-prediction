# Taxi-trip-duration-prediction

To improve the efficiency of taxi dispatching systems, it is important to be able to predict how long a driver will have his taxi occupied. If a dispatcher knew approximately when a taxi driver would be ending their current ride, they would be able to better identify which driver to assign to each pickup request.

The aim of this project is to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.
